# Project Live
## A person simulator
Currently this project is just blobs bumping into each other not doing much at all. Eventually will be people who commute to work, have houses jobs etc. Basically an empirical model of a town.

## Installing
Requires SFML, currently the makefile is for OSX. At some point I will port it to Windows / Linux
